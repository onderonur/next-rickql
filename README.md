## RickQL - Rick And Morty GraphQL App

This is a client application which consumes the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

It uses React Server Components and [TanStack Query](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for all the data fetching.

[GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) is used for creating type definitions automatically.

A feature based folder structure has been implemented to keep things organized.

**🚀 Live demo is [here](https://rick-and-morty-graphql.vercel.app/)**.

## 🌐 The Rick and Morty API

This is a really cool public API which provides you the characters, locations and episodes. It has both Rest and GraphQL implementations. So, you can use it to learn and explore new techniques, libraries etc.
